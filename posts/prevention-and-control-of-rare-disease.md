## Challenges of Rare Genetic Diseases
There are between 7000 - 8000 rare diseases reported globally. Despite technological advancements, less than 5% have therapies to treat them. As said in NPRD, 2021, “the therapies are exorbitantly costly and not universally available and accessible.”

NPRD 2021 acknowledges that the RGD research and public health policies in India are at a nascent stage. There is a need to undertake systematic epidemiological studies to ascertain the number of people suffering from rare diseases in India. Additionally, we know little about the pathophysiology or natural history of these diseases.  

Any policy on rare diseases should consider the need for the utmost judicious utilization of limited resources for maximizing  the overall health outcomes for RGD patients. The best strategy to reduce the burden of rare diseases is to prevent their occurrence. 

## Prevention of Rare Genetic Diseases

Prevention can be done at multiple levels as described in NPRD 2021 below:

## Feasibility of Strategies
NPRD 2021 points out that primary prevention strategies like avoiding pregnancy in advanced age are unrealistic. Therefore, secondary prevention is the best strategy. For secondary screening and diagnosis, NPRD recommends “a screening and diagnostic strategy wherein those pregnant women in whom there is a history of a child born with a rare disease and that rare disease diagnosis has been confirmed, would be offered prenatal screening test(s) through amniocentesis and/ or chorionic villi sampling”.

Early diagnosis of rare diseases is a challenge since we lack awareness among primary care physicians and adequate screening and diagnostic facilities. Therefore, 11 Centres of Excellence have been identified by NPRD and will be involved in screening (antenatal, neonatal) and diagnostics.
